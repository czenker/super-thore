            <p>
                This is a game about a super hero called Thore. The story is loosly based on the adventures
                of an italian plumber and his brother in the 80s, but with a new protagonist and in a modern setting.

        <h2>How is this game played?</h2>
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>You can use your keyboard or the buttons on screen.</p>
            <p>Your goal is to reach the end of the level. You can collect Power Ups from the boxes with a question mark and become Stärker!
                Just remember: You only have One Heart – if you fail, you have to start from the beginning. Once you are finished you
                advance to the Next Level.

        <h2>Why? Just tell me WHY?</h2>
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>Why not? It did not exist, so it had to be made.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Are there any eastereggs?</h2>
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>No there are no eastereggs. There is no reason to collect a mushroom, a flower, duck or finish the level at all.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Who is behind this?</h2>
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>
                This stupid idea came up in a closed WhatsApp Group called "Mein Scherz für sein Haus" (previously known as "Sportgrielwuppe").
                We are just a bunch of friends championing one another to be more silly every day.
